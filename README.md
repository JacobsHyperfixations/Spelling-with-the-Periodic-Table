# Spelling-with-the-Periodic-Table
This repository contains files related to my attempts to identify which English words can be spelled with the periodic table, or more specifically the atomic symbols.\
Link to accompanying YouTube video: TBD\
atomic_symbols.txt contains the atomic symbols and is needed for spelling_with_the_PT.py to function\
spelling_with_the_PT.py takes a txt file with words separated by new lines, spaces, or both and outputs a txt file containing which words can be spelled with the atomic symbols and another txt file containing some more information. See documentation in the code for more information.\
all_words.txt is the word list I used for the project. It was created by combining the following two word lists:\
words_alpha.txt from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words\
TWL06.txt from https://github.com/cviebrock/wordlists\
valid_words.txt contains the valid words from master_list.txt\
valid_words_stats.txt contains the valid words and bonus information.\
I can upload my figures and data analysis code if anyone is interested.\
Hope everyone has a good day
